# cs320_final_project
 My final project for cs320, Data Programming II, at UW-Madison.
 
 For this project, I scraped data from the American Statistical Association's March Randomness competition to understand how my team could have performed better.  This project displayed my data scraping skills, my Python coding skills, as well as my analytical skills (though I recognize now a PCA would have been better suited to this data than a K-means test.  I learned a lot from this course).
